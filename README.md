🧩 Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm       | Description                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bubble Sort** | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order |
| **Quick Sort**  | Divides array using a pivot and sorts recursively                 |
| **Merge Sort**  | Divides and merges sorted subarrays                               |

🧠 Project Workflow

1. User Interaction: Choose algorithm → Set speed → Click Start
2. Visualization: Bars represent array elements and their heights → Sorting is animated
3. Completion: Sorted array displayed with color changes
4. Regeneration: Click Generate to test again
